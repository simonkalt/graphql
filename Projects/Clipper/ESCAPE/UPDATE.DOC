2.0 -	* * * Initial Release * * *


2.01 -	10/27/90

        Fixed problem with soft font selection, caused by stroke width
        range of -7 to +7


2.02 - 12/24/90

        Added Library for Clipper 5.0.  This library does not use the
        public variables as documented in the manual.


2.03 - 02/02/91

        Fixed bug in HPTMARGIN().  PC LOAD EXEC problem eliminated by
        explicitly setting VMI to 8/48" before selecting page length.
        Orientation command no longer sent on every font change, only on
        page setup.  Fixed problem of soft font selection in the 5.0
        library which occured if more than one soft font was used.


2.04 - 03/09/91

        Fixed bug which caused Escape to incorrectly calculate width of
        fixed space soft fonts.

2.05 - 07/08/91

        This update reflects an update to the ESCAPE.FNT file to support
        the LaserJet Series III and the Pacific Data Products 25 in One!
        cartridge.  HPERR.PRG added as sample error trap and other
        examples modified accordingly.

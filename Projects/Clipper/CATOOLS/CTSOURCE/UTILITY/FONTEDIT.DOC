 The Nantucket Tools II Font-Editor
 --------------------------------
 The font editor is a full program to modify and generate screen fonts.
 Such fonts, in each case saved in a separate file, can be loaded
 from any Clipper application via the function FONTLOAD().
 In the program, the source code is included, so it can also be used to
 demonstrate the VIDEO- and FONT-functions of Nantucket Tools II.
 You are free to modify the program or procedures from this, resp. to
 use in own programs. So, the font editor can become a component
 of your application.


 What is a font
 --------------
 Formerly, the character settings at PC's used for the screen usually
 have been programmed in an EPROM.
 Today, various screen adapters allow to change these character
 settings by modifying the pixel pattern of separate characters.
 How many of these pixel are used for one character depends on the
 adapter and the set mode. The font editor of Nantucket Tools determines
 automatically the current pixel pattern, which of course can be
 modified.
 With Nantucket Tools II, fonts with a pixel height up to 32 pixel
 can be used. With the font editor, only fonts between 2 and 32
 pixel can be processed, which seemed to be an efficient range.


 Technical details
 -----------------
 Fonts are only supported for EGA- and VGA-adapters. For other screen
 adapters, e.g. EIZO mono set, the included font software has to be
 used.

 The number of fonts, that can be loaded in an adapter at the same
 time, is different. The number is not only depending on the used
 adapter, but also on its memory component placement. This information
 can be found out with the function MAXFONT().
 As via FONTSELECT() one font for normal and one font for high
 intensity output can be activated at the same time, up to 512
 characters can be displayed on one screen (see also Twofonts.prg
 in the SAMPLES directory).


 Compiling and linking
 ---------------------
 To be able to use the font editor, it has to be compiled and linked
 under usage of Nantucket Tools II before. For this, you have to copy
 FONTEDIT.PRG in the current directory of your hard disk.
 Then, the compiling of FONTEDIT can be started with:

                 CLIPPER FONTEDIT

 The following parameters have to be added to the link statements:

                 NT2US50.OBJ   at the .OBJ files
                 NT250.LIB     at the libraries

 After linking, FONTEDIT can be started at once. Additionally, you will
 find a .RMK file in the directory 'UTILITY', so that the font editor
 can also be generated with:

                 RMAKE FONTEDIT.

 How to start FONTEDIT
 ---------------------
 FONTEDIT.EXE can be started under specification of two file names:

 FONTEDIT [<input file> [<output file>]]

 <input file>  specifies the name of a file, out of which FONTEDIT
               has to load a font.

 <output file> specifies the name of a file, where the modified
               font has to be saved.


 How to use the editor
 ---------------------
 An unlimited number of fonts can be generated and saved, the only
 restriction is in the hard disk capacity. Once generated, fonts
 can be loaded by the editor and modified in any way.

 The font editor contains three windows, where the characters to be
 processed are displayed, a main menu on the right screen border
 and a double line status range on the bottom of the screen.

 1. window
 ---------
   The original pattern of a character is displayed.
   This is conforming to the pixel pattern of the build in ROM font
   of an adapter.

 2. window
 ---------
   The selected character with its modifications is displayed.
   This window can be selected or deselected, for this, note the
   representation of the double frame. If the window is selected,
   the active character can be modified either by activating the
   function keys described right on the screen or pixel for pixel.
   To change individual pixel, first the ON- or OFF- status has to be
   selected via space bar (displayed in the status range). Then,
   pixel can be set (ON mode) or reset (OFF mode) with the arrow keys.

 3. window
 ---------
   A complete ASCII table including all 256 characters is
   available. If this window is selected, an entered character will
   be displayed in the EDIT window for manipulation (please pay
   attention to the frame!).
   By trying to select a character with the arrow key, you will
   find out, that the Ctrl code, valid under Clipper, will be
   selected as character instead!

   SWITCHING BETWEEN WINDOW 2 AND 3 IS DONE VIA TAB KEY !


 The main menu
 -------------
 On the right border of the screen all function keys for the operation
 of the program are described. Hereby, either the function key
 or the function key in combination with 'shift' can be used.
 With the shift combination, all characters of window 3 will be
 processed (e.g. at mirroring function).

  HELP
  ----
  With this menu option a short summary of the operation of the
  font editor will be displayed.

  FONTS
  -----
   1 LOAD
   ------
   With this menu option any font file can be read. As default, a
   file mask including a complete path can be defined. By pressing
   F2, all existing font files corresponding to this file mask
   will be displayed. A file can be selected by using the arrow
   keys and the RETURN key.
   The default values for the file mask are the current directory
   and "*.0*".


   2 SAVE
   ------
   A modified font can be saved in a file. Automatically, the
   special file format, required by the function FONTLOAD(), will
   be created. The other options are described above ('LOAD').


   3 PRINT
   -------
   With the font editor and the font functions of Nantucket Tools II
   only screen fonts can be manipulated and used. Any special
   printer fonts are not supported.
   So, with this menu option, the printer can not be switched to
   a printer font mode conforming to the screen font. It is only
   to print out one or all (CAPS LOCK) characters under usage of
   block characters. In doing so, the output is conforming to the
   screen display within the edit window.


   4 ROM FONT
   ----------
   With this menu option the original ROM font of the used screen
   adapter can be loaded. However, ROM fonts are only available
   for some defined pixel heights: for EGA 8 and 14 pixel, for
   VGA 8, 14 and 16 pixel. At the attempt to load a ROM font for
   other pixel heights, an error message will be displayed.


   5 ?GA MODES
   -----------
   With this menu option, the screen modes, typical for EGA/VGA,
   with 8 pixel (43/50 rows), 14 pixel (25/28 rows) and 16 pixel
   (VGA 16 rows) can be set. Hereby, the synchron mode is set,
   so the pixel height of the actual displayed characters is
   corresponding to the edit window.


   6 PIX HEIGHT
   ------------
   As already mentioned above, the font editor allows to process
   pixel heights between 5 and 32 pixel. With this menu option,
   the pixel height can be set within that range. Hereby, the
   display shows a particularity:

   After the start, the font editor is working in synchron mode first.
   The font, currently loaded in the edit window for manipulation,
   is displayed in its real size in the ASCII window at the same time.
   Through this real size font display also the number of screen lines
   will be changed, when the pixel height is modified. The number of
   screen lines is calculated with the number of total available
   scan lines divided through the lines per pixel.
   Selecting e.g. a 32 pixel font, on a VGA adapter only 12 lines
   (400 / 32) are available now. However, in the edit window 32
   lines are required for the manipulation of one character!
   If the selected pixel height with the current settings can not
   be displayed anymore, the font editor offers two selection
   possibilities:

   1. ASYNCHRON MODE

      You quit the synchron mode. The font editor is switching into a
      display mode, that makes sufficient lines available.
      If a 32 pixel font has been selected, this would be e.g. a
      50 lines mode on a VGA adapter. With that, for the edit window
      enough lines are available, but actually, another mode is
      used (for the example mentioned above 8 pixel/line).
      Now the font can be modified in any way, but it is not
      possible to verify the result on the 'real' character of this
      pixel height at once. Of course, the font can be loaded in
      a Clipper application via FONTLOAD() later, and will be
      displayed as a real 32 pixel font!

   2. SYNCHRON MODE
      You also can remain in the synchron mode. In this case, the
      font editor is switching into a virtual screen (based on
      the SETMAXROW(<n>) function). A virtual screen can contain
      more lines than a screen can display simultaneously. By
      moving the cursor, the displayed part of the screen will be
      scrolled, whereby other parts will be made visible.

   The font editor offers the selection between sybchron and asynchron
   mode, whenever a switching is possible. A switching can also
   be performed, when the pixel height is kept.


  LINES
  -----
  This menu option calls a sub menu. With that menu pixel rows
  can be inserted, duplicated or deleted within the edit window.
  When working in the synchron mode, the modifications can be seen
  in the 'real' font immediately.

    1 DUPLICATE
    -----------
    This function copies the current pixel row in the edit
    window to the current cursor position into the character.
    Example: When you move the cursor to the lower range of an
    "A" and call this function several times, the "A" will be
    extended below.

    2 INSERT
    --------
    This function inserts an empty pixel row at the current cursor
    position in the edit window into the character.

    3 DELETE
    --------
    This function deletes a pixel row at the current cursor position
    in the edit window.


  COLUMNS
  -------
  With this menu option, pixel rows can be inserted at the left
  margin of the current selected or all characters. Hereby, also
  a pattern can be selected, where an individual indention for
  each pixel row of the character can be determined. The default
  setting of these values assigns, that a 'normal' character
  will become an italic character.


  MIRRORING
  ----------
  With this menu option the character selected in the edit window
  can be mirrored round its horizontal axis. Some mirrored
  characters equal the original character, so the modification
  is not visible.


  MIRRORING
  ----------
  With this menu option the character selected in the edit window
  can be mirrored round its vertical axis. Some mirrored
  characters equal the original character, so the modification
  is not visible.


  ROTATE
  ------
  With this menu option the character in the edit window can be
  rotated round its center. If at this process pixel of a character
  are moved to the outside of the window frame,they will be cut off!
  When the rotation of the character is still continued, these
  pixel remain 'lost'. The original of a 'destroyed' character
  can be recovered with the F10 key.


  INVERT
  ------
  With this menu option, the character in the edit window is
  inverted, that means, each pixel is represented exactly reversed.


  COPY
  ----
  This procedure copies a specified number of characters (patterns)
  either from the original font or from the edit font to any position
  within the active font.

  So you are able to:

  1. copy back a part of the original patterns after modification
     of all characters

  2. duplicate a part of the characters in the edit font to
     another position within the same font range.


  ORIGINAL
  --------
  With this menu option one or all charactes can be reset to
  the original pattern, as displayed in the ORIGINAL window.


  OVERLAY
  -------
  With this menu option two separate characters or two character
  ranges can be overlaid (mixed). Example: When the character "A"
  is overlaid with an underline "_", the result is an underlined
  "A".


 The status range
 ----------------
 In addition to some operating instructions, in the two lines
 on the bottom of the screen you will find a status display for
 the following settings:

   Input:
    The name of the file, out of which the last font has been read.

   Output:
    The name of the file, where the font will be saved by calling
    the function 'SAVE'.

   Mode:
    The current screen mode is displayed. Here, we want to refer once
    again to the fact, that you also have to work with an EGA- or
    VGA- adapter under CGA80 mode. An EGA25 or a VGA25 mode is not
    available for textdisplay!

   Rows:
    Two values, text rows and pixel rows, are displayed.

   Space:
    It is displayed, if at cursor movements in the second window
    pixel will be set (ON) or deleted (OFF). 'Space' means,
    that the space bar has to be activated to switch this status.


 Exit the program
 ----------------
 The program can be terminated with ESC. For safety reasons, you
 will be asked again, if you want to exit the program.
 Before terminating the program, you have the possibility to
 save a modified font.

DBLFN Version: 0.01
      Problem: All database functions (and FILE function) truncate the
               name portion of filename to 16 characters.
    Diagnosis: Clipper developers weren't aticipating LFNs.
       Status: Some work needs to be done on a significant amount of
               internal routines to fix this.

         User: Maurice Uijlenbroek
DBLFN Version: 0.03
      Problem: When using Exospace 1.0g, DBLFN doesn't function.
    Diagnosis: Exospace does not provide interrupt call support for the
               new calls that DOS applications use for retrieving LFNs.
       Status: Workaround may be possible with special DPMI calls using
               the Exospace API.

Dark Black Software Limited of St. Neots, England, authors of the worlds
most favourite debugger for CA-Clipper announce that MrDebug version 1.1
has now been released to the world.

MrDebug, priced at œ99, is the ultimate in debugging technology offering
serious tools to serious Clipper programmers.

MrDebug 1.0 was a evolutionary breakthrough in debugging technology for
CA-Clipper users. MrDebug 1.1 makes strengthens MrDebug's claim as best
new CA-Clipper product.

MrDebug 1.1 takes debugging technology one step further with GPF
handling and Assertion checking and many user requests for features and
additions.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

MrDebug 1.1 lists the following features and enhancements (in addition to
features already in MrDebug 1.00).

ALTD() function Changes:
   ALTD() now returns .T. if MrDebug is linked in
   ALTD( 2 ) - Animate the program
   ALTD( 3 ) - halt animation and run the program
   ALTD( 4 ) - start speed mode
   ALTD( 5 ) - halt speed mode
   ALTD( 6 ) - bring up the workarea screen
   ALTD( 7 ) - start profiling
   ALTD( 8 ) - stop profiling
   ALTD( 9 ) now creates a dump file
   ALTD( 10 ) refreshes all MrDebug windows

ALERT() function enhancement:
   An keystroke ALT-D will now interrupt an ALERT function.

ASSERTion/TRACE Checking
   MrDebug 1.1 now includes Assertion checking with TRACE and ASSERT
   functions that send messages to a new ASSERT/TRACE Window. A debugger
   is the perfect place for an ASSERTion checker.

AUTOSAVE
   This option will automatically save your setup when you leave MrDebug
   so that you don't loose any settings that you make.

BREAKPOINTS:
   The ability to select and mark source code as a Trace or Watch point.
   This even allows you to mark an expression as a trace or watch point.
   Even the mouse can be used!

BREAK COUNT POINTS
   Will stop program execution after a line has been called 'n' many
   times.

CA-TOOLS COMPATIBILITY
   MrDebug 1.1 provides compatibility with CA-Tools windowing functions
   through MrWindow.LIB, a true windowing library that users may use in
   their own applications.

COLOURS
   Not everyone likes our colours - so you can set your own colours for
   anything. You can even have up to five different colours settings.

CONDITIONAL BREAKPOINTS
   Allow you to break when an expression evaluates to a logical.

CTRL-SHIFT-+
   when pressed on a function will scan the current source code module
   for that function and take you to the function declaration.

DGROUP USAGE
   MrDebug now only uses 10 bytes of precious DGROUP

DISABLE ALTD() FUNCTIONS
   Fed up with forgetting about that ALTD() in your code? MrDebug allows
   you to disable individual ALTD()'s or all of them.

DISPLAY MODE STEP FUNCTIONS
   User-defined slots have been added to allow you to have functions
   called when the debugger is called, and when control returns to the
   program. This allows you to set and restore the graphics screen.

DON'T SHOW INIT PROCS
   MrDebug can now stop after the INIT routines have been called.

DUMP FILE
   MrDebug can automatically create a Dump file when your program
   crashes detailing information about the status of the program when
   the crash occurred, including variables, system error, workareas,
   screen shot, the call stack, memory information, visual dgroup
   information and source code.

DUPLICATE DEFINITIONS REMOVED
   MrDebug two duplicate definitions of __gtPreExt and __gtpostExt have
   been removed.

ERROR WINDOW
   Allows you to capture and examine the error object when the program
   falls over. The information in this window varies. If you have a GPF
   then the GPF is displayed in this window, otherwise the Clipper error
   object may be viewed from this window.

EXPANSION OF #INCLUDE FILES
   Simply put, press Ctrl-+ on a #INCLUDE line to see the .CH file

FUNCTION LIST
   This give you the ability to list all of the functions within the
   current source code file and go directly to it. Saves paging down
   until you find the function that you are looking for.

FAST RUN MODE
   Runs the application ignoring any break points, trace points

GPF HANDLER ADDED
   When the GPF occurs MrDebug logs the GPF details to a .GPF file. If
   the program is stable enough to continue, then MrDebug scans the .MAP
   file updates the .GPF file with Function name and modules name with
   MAP A,S and then outputs the results to the Error/GPF window.

HEX STRINGS
   Strings may now be shown in Hexadecimal !!

INSPECT
   Allows you to move inspect a particular item. Move the cursor so a
   piece of source code and if it can be evaluated it will show the
   contents.

LISTS
   List break, trace and pass points and disabled altd()'s so that you
   can easily remove them or disable them as well as view them.

MOUSE SUPPORT
   If for no other reason than to allow you to easily re-size and move
   windows, but you can also mark expressions for use as trace points or
   watch points.

MrDUMP
   A runtime crash log creation library. Similar to MrDebug's dump log
   routines. This you may link into your final application.

MrGPF
   Map file scanner included for when you are not using MrDebug or you
   are in graphical mode, or you want to scan a .GPF file.  MrGPF works
   with Blinker, Causeway and Exospace and is the fastest map scanner
   around!

MEMORY/INFO
   The memory/info window shows you lots of information about your
   program's memory, including memory settings, DGROUP, software
   versions and much more.

NOTES
   Notes Option added to MrDebug - Shift-Alt-N creates a note in a notes
   file with the current line of source code, time and date and a
   comment from you.

ENHANCED OBJECT BROWSER
   The object browser has been enhanced to allow you to view CA-Clipper
   or Class(y) objects. It includes a class hierarchy structure that
   will allow you to see easily which classes inherit from others.

PASS POINTS
   Allow you to mark a line of source code and have an counter
   incremented each time that the marked line of code is executed.

PROFILER
   MrDebug has a profiler built into the debugger so that you can see
   the slowest and fastest parts of your program and perhaps re-arrange
   your link script or your source code.

   You can even see which lines of code have not been executed.

PROTECTED MODE COMPATIBLE
   MrDebug has been designed to work in protected mode so there should
   be no compatibility problems with Blinker, Exospace or Causeway. So
   you know that no matter how big your application is MrDebug will be
   there for you. You can even restart your protected mode apps

REAL SCREEN USAGE
   MrDebug takes advantage of the text mode that you are running in.  If
   your video card supports text modes greater than 80 columns x 25 row,
   for example 132 columns by 60 rows, then you will have plenty of
   space for your debugging tools with a real output window for your
   application of 80 columns x 25 rows - no screen swap, no constant
   flicking between the debugger and the application window.

REAL MODE SUPPORT
   Over 90% of MrDebug can be overlaid with Blinker. For .RTLink users
   we have an entertaining link script.

RESTART OPTION
   MrDebug 1.1 allows you to restart your application. Instead of having
   to quit your application and re-run it. You may now run a module
   called MRD and pass it the name of your application. A Restart option
   will appear under the File menu. This works for both real mode and
   protected mode applications.

RUN MODES
   MrDebug has the following run modes:

     Go - runs the program
     Run To Cursor - runs the program to the cursor
     Single Step  - execute the next line of code
     Step Over  - run the next line without stopping
     To Next Function  - run until the next function call is made
     To End of Function  - run until the end of the current function
     Out of Code-block - run to line after code block
     To Code-block  - run until codeblock
     Fast Run - run and don't waste time!

SHORT-CUT KEYS
   MrDebug has short-cut, keystrokes for most of the operations that you
   may use. Everything is at your fingertips. Why slow your productivity
   down to a crawl by forcing you to use a mouse.

SOURCE CODE COLOUR SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
   This makes the source code easier to read and therefore quicker to
   find things within your source code. This allows you to easily tell
   the difference between keywords, operators, strings, numerics, #
   directives and comments.

SPLIT SCREEN MODE
   MrDebug even has a toggle so that you can run in split screen mode
   (80x50).

STACK WINDOW
   Shows you all the different levels of your program during the running.
   Even shows you the remaining stack space. MrDebug evens checks for DS
   available and warns you when getting short of memory. MethodName is

   Stack and DS available checking with warnings added.  MethodName now
   used for stack entries

SYMBOL LISTS
   This gives you the ability to view and search through the symbol
   list(s) to work out just what exactly has been linked in, and hence
   left out, of your program.

TEXT SEARCH
   A text search routine that allows you to search with Alt-S and search
   again with Alt-A - and it can be case sensitive.  Text search even
   highlights the found item.

TIMING RUNS
   Each run or step of your code can be timed to provide you with an
   accurate reflection of how long your code will take to run.

TRACKED VARIABLES
   Allow you to watch or trace particular instances of the same variable
   through different levels of the callstack within your application.

VARIABLE WINDOW
   Show you the variables currently available. Each may be toggled on or
   off with Alt-L for locals, Alt-S for statics, Alt-P for publics and
   Alt-V for privates. The first level of arrays are shown, strings can
   be shown in Hexadecimal, string lengths are shown, variables passed
   by ref can be viewed/edited. Local variable that have not been
   used may be shown and variables that have been changed during the
   last step can be highlighted.

VISUAL DGROUP
   Visual DGROUP graph now included within the Memory/Info window - you
   can now see the different parts of DGROUP and see how much DS
   available you have left.

WORKAREA SCREEN
   Allows you to do what you want to your data tables. If you want to
   browse the data - no problem. If you want to edit the dat - no
   problem. If you want to set a relation, a filter, a record lock -
   no problem.

   You can locate, goto a record, seek and expression, open or close
   tables, view SIX driver settings or Comix settings

   More like DBU than CLD!

WORKAREA WINDOW
   A real window that allows you to see each currently open table
   with the current index and the current record. You may have this
   on screen throughout your program debug cycle.

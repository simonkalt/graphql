Fix/Revision history

0.01 - 24th Jan 1997 - Initial version


0.02 - 30th Jan 1997 - First public beta

   Added LFNSupport() function by request of Phillip Ide.

0.03 -  3rd Feb 1997 - Second public beta

   Fixed _fsCurDir/_tcurdir.  The return string would most likely be
   garbage.  I'd moved the buffer out of DGROUP but had forgot to change
   the code for the return address.

   Added some comments to the headers of the functions in FILESYS.ASM

   Added _tcreat, _topen, _tdelete, _terror functions for 5.0x.  I've done
   my best with the names.  I don't have 5.0x installed at the moment, so
   if someone could check these out please?

   Added 80286 support, which you will have to recompile the librry for.
   Of course, you won't be able to use it on a 8088/8086 processor, but
   who uses those nowadays anyway?  ;-)

   Performed some optimizations on the code.  It appears that they used
   macros to create the functions, so there were some unnecessary
   instructions in there.

0.04 -  7th Feb 1997 - Third public beta

   Added LFNShort() function so you can convert a long filename into it's
   equivelant 8.3 format filename.

0.05 - 11th Feb 1997 - Fourth public beta

   Fixed the Directory() function getting the volume label, and also
   failing on normal 8.3 directory mode.

   Oh, and the previous version was compiled with C/ASM debug info.... Now
   it isn't....

The ftp site for CA-Clipper programmers who need to satisfy their thirst!

We would like to hear from you if any .ZIP you download from us has
problems, or if any of our downloads are not of GOOD quality.

This file, and thousands of other files, are brought to you by my
sponser, Communications Horizons. Without Neil Weicher's help, I would
have to abandon The Oasis.

In March of 1997 alone, over 4 gigabytes of files were transferred from
The Oasis to CA-Clipper programmers all over the world.

All of you who have used The Oasis owe a big thank you to Neil Weicher
at Communications Horizons.

Without arguing about price, he wanted to know how he could help Clipper
programmers to continue using the language, and now he supports most of
the huge amount of ftp traffic on The Oasis.

Of course, the nicest thank you that Neil could possibly get would be
for you to purchase his outstanding CA-Clipper networking library.

Not willing to be left behind, Neil has added many new functions which
directly address networking under Windows '95 and Windows NT.

When you need to address a printer queue, the functionality is there to
support multiple operating systems. I assume you have all figured out
that Windows is here to stay, so we must be able to deal with it
intelligently, without sacrificing Novell Netware compatibility.

NetLib is the most intelligent, multi O/S, richly functional network
library in the world today.

Say thanks to Neil, while you are ordering...
